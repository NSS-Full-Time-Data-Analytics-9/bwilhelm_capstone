## Motivation
Growing up my family loved to travel and take trips together.  As my family has continued to grow, I have had the please and joy of experiencing the joys of family vacations as a parent.  As my wife and I plan these trips, much like when I was a child growing up, we are always drawn to the beach and all that a beach vacation has a to offer.  Whether it be the feeling of sand between the toes, the cuisine, or the beuatiful weather that traveling south has to offer, there is no feeling quite like that of traveling to the beach.  I  wanted to take this opportunity to research beaches that are within a driveable distance (~7-9 hours) from Nashville, TN.  When looking at at options of beaches to eplore and examine, I narrowed this study to the following beaches:

- Dauphin Island (Alabama)
- Orange Beach (Alabama)
- Miramar Beach (Florida)
- Panama City (Florida)
- Tybee Island (Georgia)
- Gulfport (Mississippi)
- Isle of Palms (South Carolina)

When exploring these beaches, I want to find out which areas offer the safest travel and the ideal time of year to travel to each location based on recent weather trends and data.  When looking at safety ratings for each area/county, I will be looking at crime rates from 2007-2020 and traffic accident rates from each area/county from 2017-2021.  I will also use weather data from the last 10 years (2013-2022) when exploring and analyzing trends in weather from each location.
